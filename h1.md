# Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is the process of assessing or studying depictions of systems to gain knowledge about security and privacy characteristics. We perform threat modeling to find out what could possibly go wrong in a system and threat modeling is not limited to one person anyone who is worried about the privacy, safety, and security of their systems can threat model.

Threat modeling should answer th following questions;

-What are we working on?
-What can go wrong?
-What are we going to do about it?
-Did we do a good enough job?

## Advantages 
Some advantages of threat modeling include;
- Increased security awareness
- Helps in identifying risks early on (which is more efficient)
- Improved visibility of the target of evaluation(the system)

## Approaches in threat modeling
-System Modeling: You have to ask yourself what are you building to understand the system "what are we working on".
-Threat identification: You have to ask yourself what can go wrong to identify the threats.
-Response: Now that you understand the system and possible threats you have to ask yourself what are you going to do about it.
-Review: After the threat model has been reviewed by everyone stakeholders development team e.t.c you have to ask yourself "did we do a good enough job".
