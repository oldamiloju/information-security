# Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is the process of assessing or studying depictions of systems to gain knowledge about security and privacy characteristics. We perform threat modeling to find out what could possibly go wrong in a system and threat modeling is not limited to one person anyone who is worried about the privacy, safety, and security of their systems can threat model.

Threat modeling should answer the following questions;
- What are we working on?
- What can go wrong?
- What are we going to do about it?
- Did we do a good enough job?

## Advantages 
Some advantages of threat modeling include;
- Increased security awareness
- Helps in identifying risks early on (which is more efficient)
- Improved visibility of the target of evaluation(the system)

## Approaches in threat modeling
- System Modeling: You have to ask yourself what are you building to understand the system "what are we working on".
- Threat identification: You have to ask yourself what can go wrong to identify the threats.
- Response and Mitigations: Now that you understand the system and possible threats you have to ask yourself what are you going to do about it.
- Review: After the threat model has been reviewed by everyone stakeholders development team e.t.c you have to ask yourself "did we do a good enough job".

# Security Hygiene Practices
- Compainies and people in general should have a network firewall to protect data and prevent unauthorized users from accessing data.
- Software and Systems should be kept up to date.
- Cybersecurity training and awareness programs should be provided to employees and individuals.
- Sensitive data should be encrypted so that it can only be accessed by the correct encryption key.
- Use of strong and unique passwords.

# Imaginary company - AfriMoodu
AfriMoodu is a learning system similar to moodle for educational purposes and enhances educational experience also making everything easier. It allows teachers or educators manage the courses with students homework e.t.c. Our priority is to protect our users data.

Using what threat modeling should answer we've answered what are working on next we must identify what can go wrong and identify possible threats I'll be using STRIDE for this. Threat actors could include hackers or employees who are trying to sabotage a company e.t.c.
## Possible Threats
- Impersonating users: This would be under spoofing and violates authenticity. This is when an attacker steals the authentication token of a legitimate user and uses it to impersonate the user.(this would probably the most common type of threat for this system)
- Unofficial modification of data: This would be under tampering and violates integrity. This when an attacker performs unauthorized data modification to databases maybe to change grades or things like that.

There are other possible threats as well not just these.

Next we must answer the question "what are we going to do about it" basically response and mitigations.
## Response and Mitigations
These below are the following threat responses;
- Mitigate
- Eliminate
- Transfer
- Accept

### Possible mitigations
- Usage of strong and unique passwords: The use of strong and complex passwords should be enforced.
- Usage of multi factor authentication: This should be applied for all users.
- Implementation of data integrity checks: This should be implemented to verify and secure important data.
- Account should be locked after a number of failed attempts.

After all these steps have been done we have to answer if we did a good enough job. To answer this we have to go through tests like penetration testing security assessments evaluation e.t.c. Also note that this is not a one time job its a process that never ends.
- Security Audits: This should be performed to review and examine system records and activities to check, prevent and pinpoint any data breach.
- Penetration Testing: We should use this test to simulate cyberattacks on our system and identify possible vulnerabilities attackers might exploit.
- Assessments: This gives us an idea of how secure our systems are and what needs to be improved
- Continous Threat modeling and evaluation: If there are new threated or exploits in the system this ensures it is handled speedily.
