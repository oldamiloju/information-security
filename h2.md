# Cyber Kill Chain Summary
## What does the phrase "kill chain" mean?
This basically defines the structure of an intrusion and a kill chain model shows the analysis to inform the right authorities. A kill chain analysis shows how an invader must go from one point to the other successfully from each point of the chain before it can achieve its objective. We can use a cyber kill chain model to interfere and get solution to attacks with attacks.

## What are the key Components of a Cyber Kill Chain
Using what was learned from the paper read it talks about 7 stages of a cyber attack namely;

- Reconnaissance - this is when the intruder gathers information to identify possible exploits.
- Weaponization - this is when the intruder attaches stuff like such malware to things like emails or links.
- Delivery - this is when the intruder gets their weapon to whoever the target is.
- Exploitation - this is what happens after its been delivered when the weapon is executed on the host target.
- Installation - this is when a backdoor or a trojan is installed to the victims system to maintain persistence in the environment.
- Command and Control - this is when the intruder gain hands on access inside of the target environment.
- Actions on Objectives - after all the six previous stages are completed this is when the intruder can achieve whatever their initial goal was usually the theft of data.

## Possible Courses of Action For Each Phases

Reconnaissance Phase;
- Detect - use web analytics.
- Deny - use of firewall ACL.

Weaponization Phase;
- Detect - NIDS (network intrusion detection system).
- Deny - use of NIPS (network intrusion drevention system).

Delivery Phase;
- Detect - be a vigilant user to notice these things on time.
- Deny - use a proxy filter.
- Disrupt - use an in line antivirus.
- Degrade - queuing.

Exploitation Phase;
- Detect - use of HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System).
- Deny - patch exploits.
- Disrupt use of DEP (Data Execution Prevention).

Installation Phase;
- Detect - use of HIDS.
- Deny - use of "Chroot" jail (this is a method that prevents unauthorized installation).
- Disrupt - use of antivirus.

Command and Control (C2) Phase;
- Detect - use of NIDS.
- Deny - use of firewall ACL.
- Disrupt - use of NIPS.
- Degrade - use Tarpits.
- Deceive - use of DNS redirection to send intruders to wrong locations.

Actions on Objectives Phase;
- Detect - use audit logs.
- Degrade - quality of service.
- Deceive - use of honeypots (this lures attackers and misdirects them from important stuff).

Before reading this study i never new what cyber kill chain was but after this i know how useful the topic is the steps i should take in case i ever have an encounter like this.



# Installation Of Debian 12

Firstly we install virtualbox if it isnt installed the from the menu we click on new then create virtual machine. Remember to change it to expert mode to get all the options and change the memory size to 4000 then we name it. After this we head to the hard disk section and we change it to 60gb also make sure you selected virtual box disk image and note that it only takes ass much space as it uses it changes dynamically. When done click on create.Select your new virtual machine then head to settings then storage tabs then go under Controller: IDE and choose the CDROM Empty on the right under Attributes beside Optical Drive: IDE Secondary Master, click the tiny CDROM icon to open a menu after this choose Virtual optic disk file then find your ISO disk image and BOOM we have a virtual machine thats ready to boot. Now go back to virtualbox and boot up the new virtual machine. When the bootloader appears choose to live you should boot to live desktop even if you're going to install so you can test Linux before you decide whether or not you want to install. Test if everything is functional like network keyboard mouse e.t.c just make sure everything is functional before we go on. After this click on install debian on your homescreen then change your location to finland and keyboard to finnish then when you get to partitions select erase disk as this is the most reliable option it deletes any junk left by previous operating systems. After this we get to users and password use your full name and when making a password remember to make it a good password i.e unique and complex then when done click on install this can take up to 10 minutes so be patient. When done click on restart and log in if you want to update whats available go to terminal emulator and type "sudo apt-get update" then hit enter as seen in the picture down below('sudo' means use superuser privileges)
