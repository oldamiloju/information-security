# Installation Of Debian 12

Firstly we install virtualbox if it isnt installed the from the menu we click on new then create virtual machine. Remember to change it to expert mode to get all the options and change the memory size to 4000 then we name it. After this we head to the hard disk section and we change it to 60gb also make sure you selected virtual box disk image and note that it only takes ass much space as it uses it changes dynamically. When done click on create.Select your new virtual machine then head to settings then storage tabs then go under Controller: IDE and choose the CDROM Empty on the right under Attributes beside Optical Drive: IDE Secondary Master, click the tiny CDROM icon to open a menu after this choose Virtual optic disk file then find your ISO disk image and BOOM we have a virtual machine thats ready to boot. Now go back to virtualbox and boot up the new virtual machine. When the bootloader appears choose to live you should boot to live desktop even if you're going to install so you can test Linux before you decide whether or not you want to install. Test if everything is functional like network keyboard mouse e.t.c just make sure everything is functional before we go on. After this click on install debian on your homescreen then change your location to finland and keyboard to finnish then when you get to partitions select erase disk as this is the most reliable option it deletes any junk left by previous operating systems. After this we get to users and password use your full name and when making a password remember to make it a good password i.e unique and complex then when done click on install this can take up to 10 minutes so be patient. When done click on restart and log in if you want to update whats available go to terminal emulator and type "sudo apt-get update" then hit enter as seen in the picture down below('sudo' means use superuser privileges)
