From what we see port 25 open smtp and 631 open ipp are running

# Daemon
Now we install Daemon which is a server application and port scan again meaning you have to enable network again install then disconnect
to install this we type;
"sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2"

if you noticed unlike before we now have port 80 open http running because apache that we installed iss running
