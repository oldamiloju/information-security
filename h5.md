# Applied Cryptography Foundations
## Main points i got from this
When it comes to cryptography words like plaintext, ciphertext, encryption, decryption, key, and algorithms are explained to us as the fundamentalals of cryptographic systems. Cryptography has been around for a long time from ciphers like caesar's cipher to modern cryptographic algorithms.
Cryptanalysis is the process of analyzing and decrypting ciphers, codes, and encrypted text without using the real key. 
Substitution and Transposition ciphers substitution ciphers replaces characters while transposition ciphers rearranges them.
Symmetric algorithms are algorithms where the encryption key can be calculated from the decryption key and the other way around as well.
Public key algorithms are made so that the key used for encryption is different from the key used for decryption.T he decryption key cannot be calculated from the encryption key.

# PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg
GPG full meaning is GNU privacy guard, is a popular way to encrypt and sign it uses a combination of symmetric key cryptography and public key cryptography. Linux kernel development uses uses PGP signatures so its likely you are using it. What i learned from this was;
- how to set up pgp
- how to encrypt messages
- how to sign messages
- examples showing what to do

# Encrypt and decrypt a message with using PGP public key cryptography
First we have to generate a keypair so we type 
"sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get install gpg micro psmisc" 
Next to create the keypair "gpg --gen-key"
and give your full name and an email for this test we dont need a password

Now you want to export your cd key like i did in the picture below

Now we create an imaginary person alice and generate her keypair as well like before

Now Alice imports the key of yourself(name used in beginning) in my case "daniel"

Now we refer to keys with their email addresses you see this with the email address when gotten type the following.

![Screenshot 2024-09-21 195258](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0aebe0c-93e6-4fea-a7ea-6199cf6655f6)
We now see the trust shown
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc0b70aa-ee8f-4341-8019-de1be4c10fbd)

Now we need our users to access alices public key do as seen below
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93b86462-58e4-4f35-83c0-44936e4e0220)

now the trust has been established and we can send messages between them!!
to do that refer to the link below

# Password manager
For this i am using enpass as its very reliable and arguably the best open and cloudless password manager so first go to their website download and install then set it up. To add passwords in enpoass open the vault and add item its really simple then fill in details and save this stores passwords locally as it is not cloud based.

We need password managers;
- For secure storage and management of passwords
- As it allows us to generate and use more complex passwords while not worrying about forgetting them
- As it notifies us if password is weak and also possible data breaches
