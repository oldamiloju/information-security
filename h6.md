# Applied Cryptography 
## One Way Functions And One Way Hash Functions
One way functions: These are a fundamental building blocks for most protocols explained in this book. One way functions are pretty easy to get an output from any input, but they are way harder to reverse the process and try to determine the input from the output.

One way hash functions: These have many names such as fingerprint, message integrity check, compression function etc. They transform input of variable lengths into a fixed length output, which is called a hash value. These fixed length output makes them useful for specific cryptographic applications.

# Hashcat
Firstly we install hashcat type the following below in the terminal to do this;
$ sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget

After we have to create a directory for our work
$ mkdir hashed
$ cd hashed

And also we need to get a big dictionary
$ wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz

Then
$ tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz
$ rm rockyou.txt.tar.gz

After this It's just one word after another
$ head rockyou.txt


$ wc -l rockyou.txt 
14344391 rockyou.txt

Now to learn how to identify Hashes
We will be using '6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' for this

to identify this type
$ hashid -m 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96
then it analyzes the hash and gives information

Now to crack it after identifying we use the command hashcat
$ hashcat -m 0 '6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' rockyou.txt -o solved

in case youre wondering what -m 0 is it means the type of the hash, the number we obtained from 'hashid' and -o solved is so that it saves the solution as plain text to a new file "solved" in the directory we created earlier now if we go to that directory and open the file you see we have successfully cracked the hash

## Cracking Another Hash
Using what we learned first we analyze the hash like earlier

Then we use the hashcat command to crack it as well like earlier

Then the filename we saved it as we go to the directory and check our results

and here we see our results
