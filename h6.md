# Applied Cryptography 
## One Way Functions And One Way Hash Functions
One way functions: These are a fundamental building block for most protocols explained in this book. One way functions are pretty easy to get an output from any input, but they are way harder to reverse the process and try to determine the input from the output.

One way hash functions: These have many names such as fingerprint, message integrity check, compression function etc. They transform input of variable lengths into a fixed length output, which is called a hash value. These fixed length output makes them useful for specific cryptographic applications.
